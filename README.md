# NAME

Task::Date::Holidays - Work distribution for holiday modules in the Date::Holidays namespace

# SYNOPSIS

    $ tar xvzf Task-Date-Holidays-0.12.tgz

    $ cd Task-Date-Holidays-0.12

    $ perl Build.PL

    $ ./Build install

    # hack, hack, hack

    # take some holiday

# DESCRIPTION

THis distribution is intended to provide an easy way to install all of the Date::Holidays::\* distributions.

Bundling these makes it easier for me, in the work related to maintaining [Date::Holidays](https://metacpan.org/pod/Date%3A%3AHolidays).

If your distribution is missing send me a pull request or just let me know.

If you want to provide a distribution to the namespace, please see Date::Holidays for more information.

Do note that because a distribution is listed in the below list, does not necessarily make it compatible with the Date::Holidays API. Distributions listed here indicate that a given distribution is either compatible or being considered for inclusion.

Please see [Date::Holidays](https://metacpan.org/pod/Date%3A%3AHolidays)
